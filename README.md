<h2>Desgin Challenge</h2>

<p>
Health Bank One invited our Applied Experience Design class at UTD during the Spring 2025 semester to design concepts that boost user engagement and retention in its app. This challenge seeks features and designs that drive user value, repeat use, and long-term engagement. The target demographic is women aged 40-65 who either manage chronic conditions for themselves or their family members, and proactive, health-conscious women. Our class consisted of multiple teams, so half of the teams would focus on chronic conditions and the other half would focus on health and wellness. My team decided to focus on chronic conditions. The goal of the project is to understand user motivations and needs by conducting design research methods, design mobile app wireframes of proposed features, and developing a high-fidelity prototype showcasing the solutions. 
</p>

<h2>The Problem</h2>

<p>
When middle-aged women with chronic health conditions need to manage their medical records and track their health, they want a user-friendly, accessible app that integrates with wearables, tracks lab trends, and securely stores all health records so they can conveniently monitor their health, access records in one place, and make informed decisions about their care.
</p>

<h2>The Solution</h2>

<p>
To solve the problem, my team decided to expand on the existing features of the Health Bank One app and add key features: Health Dashboard, Daily Health Log, Lab Reports, Trend Analysis, and Medication Tracker. The goal is to increase the functionality and practicality by giving users more reasons to use the app. Health Bank One would go from an app primarily for medical record consolidation to an all-purpose health app.
